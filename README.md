# Charm-Wireframe: The Boilerplate for Charm Framework Projects

Welcome to the Charm-Wireframe, the foundation of your intergalactic journey in the
[Charm Framework](https://github.com/neoground/charm) universe. This
boilerplate provides you with everything you need to kickstart your next web application or API project. Fear not, young
Padawan, you can either download and use this wireframe directly or employ the bob tool to auto-install it. For more
information on using bob, refer to the [Charm Framework documentation](https://neoground.com/docs/charm/index).

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to harness the power of the Charm Framework:

### Simply use `bob`

Install bob on your machine and run `bob new your_project_name` to create a new project. For more details on using bob,
consult the [Charm Framework documentation](https://neoground.com/docs/charm/start.installation).

```bash
curl -fSsL -o bob https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoground/charm-toolkit/main/bob && chmod +x bob
./bob new HoloArchive
```

### Manual way

Clone the Charm-Wireframe repository into a new folder on your local machine:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/neoground/charm-wireframe.git /path/to/new/folder
cd /path/to/new/folder
```

You now have the base project ready and can start setting it up.
